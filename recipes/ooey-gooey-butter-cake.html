        <p>Gooey butter cake, aka Ooey Gooey Butter Cake, is a rich, dense, and butter dessert 
           with origins from St. Louis, Missouri. This soft and sweet dessert has a base of 
           ultra-buttery yellow cake with a cream cheese-based topping, dusted with powdered sugar. It originated 
           in the 1930s in a baking accident where butter and flour proportions
           were reversed, resulting in a sweet, mildly addictive confection that is often served
           as coffee cake.
