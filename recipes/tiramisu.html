    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 Cups Espresso at room temperature</li>
            <li>6 TBS Golden Rum, divided</li>
            <li>6 Egg Yolks</li>
            <li>3/4 Cup Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>16-ounces mascarpone</li>
            <li>2 Cups Heavy Whipping Cream, Cold</li>
            <li>2-3 TBS Unsweetened Coca Powder, to dust top</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h5>Dip</h5>
                <p>In a bowl, stir together 1 1/2 cups espresso and 3 Tbsp rum. Quickly dip half of the ladyfingers, one at a time, and then arrange them in a single layer in the bottom of a 9U+00d7 13 casserole dish. 
                    Dip once on each side so they are moist, but do not soak ladyfingers or the cake will collapse.</p></li>
            <li><h5>Mix the Tiramisu Mascapapone</h5>
                <h5>Whisk</h5>
                <p>In a separate rimmed* medium glass bowl, whisk together yolks and sugar. Place over steam (on a saucepan with simmering water) and whisk 10 minutes on low heat until the mixture is lighter in color, 
                   slightly thickened, and not grainy when you rub between your fingers. 
                   Remove from heat and whisk for a few minutes off the heat to help it cool down. Then set it aside to cool while doing step 3.
                   In a separate bowl, beat together 16 oz Mascarpone and 3 Tbsp rum. Use an electric hand mixer to beat in the warm yolk mixture until well incorporated.</p>
                <h5>Whip</h5> 
                <p>In a separate chilled bowl, beat cold heavy whipping cream until stiff peaks form*. Use a spatula to gently fold half of the whipped cream into Mascarpone cream, then blend in the remaining whipped cream, just until incorporated. 
                   Do not overfold, or it will become grainy.</p></li>
            <li>Spread half of the cream over the first layer of ladyfingers. Dip and arrange the remaining ladyfingers on top, and then spread the remaining cream on top. 
                Cover with foil and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Dust with cocoa powder before serving. It is ok to dust with cocoa ahead of time "-" the color will just darken from the moisture.</li>
        </ol>
